        <h2>1. Key Drivers of Global Supply Chains</h2>

        <section>
            <p>Globalization and technological advancements have made it possible for companies to break down the production process and source components from around the world to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.</p>

            <h3>Core Economic Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Comparative Advantage:** The primary reason for specialization and trade between countries.</li>
                <li>**Economies of Scale:** Lower costs achieved by increasing production volume.</li>
                <li>**Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory:** A strategy to increase efficiency and reduce waste by receiving goods only as they are needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h2>3. Understanding Disruption and Risk</h2>

        <p>Recent events like geopolitical conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the fragility of overly optimized supply chains, leading many firms to consider **reshoring** or **diversification**.</p>
